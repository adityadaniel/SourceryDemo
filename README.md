# SourceryDemo

This is demo project for iOS Pintar sharing session. There's Sourcery configuration files on the root of the folder that describe where's the template location as well as where generated code should be located.

If you want to try writing template for Sourcery, you can use auto generation mode.

Run:
`sourcery --config .sourcery.yml -w`
